# How to use
Once you run the program, the user will be given a prompt.

The user must choose what wins conditions they desire for the game,
usually this will be 4.

Then the first and second player will take turns choosing the places the pieces are placed.

Once a player reaches the chosen win condition, a window will display stating that player has won.

After that, the original window will appear, and the game may continue.

If the player chooses to play again they can, or they can click cancel and the window will close.
